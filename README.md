## Trump Facebook Messenger Bot

This project utilizes a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on tweets posted by @theRealDonaldTrump from 2009 to the present. The training was performed using Lua and a char-rnn model.

## Dataset Acquisition

To gather the necessary tweet data, we utilized the comprehensive collection available at [Trump Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive). The tweet texts were aggregated into a single input file named `trainData/input.txt`. This file serves as the training data for the character-level RNN. 

## Model Training

The training process involved feeding the `input.txt` file to the character-level RNN, which can be found [here](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). The model was trained for approximately 4 hours. During training, the model was primed with specific texts such as "hello" and "I like" to generate responses. The generated responses, limited to 100 characters each, were aggregated into a file named `all.txt` within the output directory.

## Chatbot Functionality

The Facebook Messenger chatbot, accessible [here](https://www.facebook.com/hackmit2017trumpbot/), utilizes the `all.txt` file as a response database. Upon receiving user input, the chatbot retrieves appropriate responses from the database and delivers them to the user.

## Usage

Feel free to interact with the chatbot by typing any message. Prepare to be entertained by the amusing and engaging responses generated by the model.
